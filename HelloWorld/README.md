# HelloWorld Sample Application

This is a Hello World-like sample application for the BlackBerry PlayBook tablet that uses HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS. This application displays an image and a button. When users click the button, their GPS coordinates are returned and displayed on the screen along with some location-related information. 

This application was created for the [Creating your First application tutorial](https://developer.blackberry.com/html5/documentation/ww_tutorials/tutorial_create_first_app_intro_1969476_11.html).

## How to Build

To build the HelloWorld sample application, complete the following steps:

1. Click on the **Downloads** tab above.
2. Select **Download as zip** (Windows) or **Download as tar.gz** (Mac) and save the downloaded file to your local machine.
3. Create a new folder on your local machine named **helloworld** (for example, **C:\Documents and Settings\User\WebWorks\HelloWorld** (Windows) or **~/WebWorks/HelloWorld** (Mac).
4. Open the downloaded ZIP file from step 2 and extract the contents **from inside the zipped HelloWorld folder** to your local **HelloWorld** folder from step 3.  This ensures that the necessary application assets, such as **config.xml**, are correctly located at the top level of the local **HelloWorld** folder (e.g. **~/WebWorks/HelloWorld/config.xml**).
5. Using the **[Ripple Mobile Emulator](http://developer.blackberry.com/html5/download/ripple)** and either the **[BlackBerry WebWorks SDK for Smartphone](http://developer.blackberry.com/html5/download/sdk)** or the **[BlackBerry WebWorks SDK for Tablet OS](http://developer.blackberry.com/html5/download/sdk)**, package the contents of your local **HelloWorld** folder into a BlackBerry application.  Enter the project root settings field as the local folder created in step 3, and the archive name settings field as **HelloWorld**.
